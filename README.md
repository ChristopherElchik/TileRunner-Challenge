# TileRunner-Challenge
 Tile Runner challenge for Zebra Robotics

To-do list:

- Make the code work
- ^^ Break that statement down into several more specific statements
- fix visual bug: Visual grid is transposed (i.e, MOVE_DOWN moves right)
- Separate grading simulation from visualization (using VISUALIZE boolean)
- Add images for visuals (Maybe? Would require students to download more files...)
- Clean up comments
- Add documentation and instructions for students
- Optimize (Repeated simulation is super slow)
- Get people to test
