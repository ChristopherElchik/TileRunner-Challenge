# TileRunner-Challenge
 Tile Runner challenge for Zebra Robotics

To-do list:

- Make the code work
- ^^ Break that statement down into several more specific statements
- Finish initialize_sets() function
- Make check_goal() function, try making it more optimized than counting every single tile every single time
- Separate grading simulation from visualization (using VISUALIZE boolean)
- Add images for visuals (Maybe? Would require students to download more files...)
- TEST!!!
